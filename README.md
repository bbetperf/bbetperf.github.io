# Portfolio website.
The [site](https://bbetperf.github.io/) was developed as part of the course work at the 2nd year of Software Engineering at [RTU MIREA](https://www.mirea.ru/). The design was updated in 2024.

I pay only **_$1_** a month to support this site, to pay for a domain name. The 3D component is implemented on a free subscription in [Spline](https://spline.design), the watermark is removed using HTML and JS. Compared to [Webflow pricing](https://webflow.com/pricing), my savings are at least **_$13_** per month or **_$156_** per year.
