# Portfolio website.
The [site](https://bbetperf.github.io/) was developed as part of the course work at the 2nd year of Software Engineering at [RTU MIREA](https://www.mirea.ru/). The design was updated in 2023.

I pay only $1 a month to support this site, to pay for a domain name. The 3D component is implemented on a free subscription in [Spline](https://spline.design), the watermark is removed using HTML and JS. Compared to [Webflow pricing](https://webflow.com/pricing), my savings are at least $13 per month or $156 per year.

## Main stages:
1. Analysis of other people's portfolio sites;
2. Design, texts;
3. Layout;
4. Scripts;
5. Adaptive.
